# Password Generator Starter Code
An employee would like to create a secure password but does not want to think of their own. That's where we come in. This is the password generator.

The password generator will generate a randomized string of characters to set as your new password!

The user can specify their own password constraints: password length, use of special characters, use of uppercase characters, user of lowercase characters, and numerical values.
